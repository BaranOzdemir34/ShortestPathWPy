# ShortestPathWPy
This repo is for my Analysis of Algorithms Project about shortest path.
The project consists of 10 nodes named 1...10:
There exist an edge from node i to node j if | i - j | <= 3, and i and j are not equal.
First part of the project is to use the Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path.
Second part is to use the A* algorithm.
